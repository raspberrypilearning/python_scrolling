legend: Question 3 of 3
---

You made a game that you're really pleased with and shared it. A player has reviewed it and has shared some thoughtful feedback with some changes they would like to see.

What would be the best way to react to their suggestions?

--- choices ---

- ( ) Immediately make all the changes they have suggested.

  --- feedback ---

It's great to get feedback, but you shouldn't change your game just to keep one player happy, maybe other players might give different feedback.

  --- /feedback ---

- ( ) Ignore the suggestions because you know best.

  --- feedback ---

Not quite. It's usually worth listening to what your users have to say about your work. If a player has given constructive feedback, then you should consider it.

  --- /feedback ---

- (x) Consider their feedback with other feedback and decide how to improve your game.

  --- feedback ---

Correct! You should consider any feedback you get — while always trying to get more than one point of view — and make decisions to improve the game for all players.

  --- /feedback ---

- ( ) Feel really sad that the player didn't think your game was perfect.

  --- feedback ---

No! You shouldn't feel sad if someone suggests improvements to your game. Constructive feedback is really useful and can help improve your game. You should be pleased that they were interested enough in your game to give feedback.
