### 1つの障害物から始める

プレイヤーを作ったのと同じ方法で障害物を作ることができます。 障害物はあなたのテーマにふさわしいですか？

コピーをたくさん作るのに `for` ループを使うので、障害物は1つ作るか選ぶだけで済みます。

`draw_obstacles()` 関数を定義します。

--- code ---
---
language: python filename: main.py - draw_obstacles() line_numbers: false line_number_start:
line_highlights: 4
---

def draw_obstacles(): ob_x = width/2 ob_y = height/2 text('🌵', ob_x, ob_y)  # Replace with your obstacle

--- /code ---

`draw()`にコードを追加して、フレームごとに`draw_obstacles()`を呼び出すようにします。

--- code ---
---
language: python filename: main.py - draw() line_numbers: false line_number_start:
line_highlights: 5
---

def draw(): global safe safe = Color(200, 100, 0)  # Add the colour of your theme background(safe) draw_obstacles()  # Before drawing the player draw_player()

Images included in the starter project will be shown in the `Image gallery`.

![The Image gallery displaying the included images.](images/starter-images.png)

Make a note of the name of the image you want to use.

Load the image into the `setup()` function

--- code ---
---
language: python filename: main.py - setup() line_numbers: true line_number_start: 9
line_highlights: 12
---

def setup(): size(400, 400) global player player = load_image('skiing.png')  # Load your player image obstacle = load_image('rocket.png')  # Load your obstacle image

--- /code ---

Find the line `# Keep this to run your code`. Before that line, define a new `draw_obstacles()` function, call `obstacle` as a global variable and use it in the call to `image()`.

--- code ---
---
language: python
filename: main.py - draw_obstacles()
---

def draw_obstacles(): ob_x = width/2 ob_y = height/2

    global obstacle
    
    image(obstacle, ob_x, ob_y, 30, 30)  # Resize to fit your theme

You can use emoji characters in the p5 `text()` function to represent your obstacles.

Here's an example:

--- code ---
---
language: python
filename: main.py - setup()
---

def setup(): size(400, 400) text_size(40)  # Controls the size of the emoji text_align(CENTER, TOP)  # Position around the centre

--- /code ---

Find the line `# Keep this to run your code`. Before that line, define a new `draw_obstacles()` function.

--- code ---
---
language: python
filename: main.py - draw_obstacles()
---

def draw_obstacles(): ob_x = width/2 ob_y = height/2 text('🌵', ob_x, ob_y)

**Tip:** You can use several simple shapes in the same function to create a more complex obstacle.

### 障害物を動かす

Now add code to increase the `y` position of the obstacle each frame, and have it wrap around when it gets to the bottom to create the effect of another obstacle.

The p5 `frame_count` variable starts counting the frames when you click run.

`ob_y %= height` sets the `y` position to the remainder when divided by `height`. With a `height` of '400', this will turn `401` into `1` so when the obstacles goes off the bottom of the screen, it reappears at the top.

--- code ---
---
language: python
filename: main.py - draw_obstacles()
---

def draw_obstacles(): ob_x = width/2 ob_y = height/2 + frame_count  # Increases each frame ob_y %= height  # Wrap around text('🌵', ob_x, ob_y)  # Replace with your obstacle

--- /code ---

--- /task ---

### たくさんの障害物

You could draw lots of copies of your obstacle at different starting locations but that's quite a lot of work. Let's use a shortcut.

<p style="border-left: solid; border-width:10px; border-color: #0faeb0; background-color: aliceblue; padding: 10px;"> 
<span style="color: #0faeb0">**Procedural generation**</span> is used in the creation of game worlds, obstacles, and movie scenes to create randomness but with certain rules applied. A <span style="color: #0faeb0">seed</span> means you can generate the same results every time you use the same seed.</p>

--- task ---

This code uses a `for` loop with `randint()` to choose obstacle positions for you. Calling the random `seed()` function first means that you will always get the same random numbers. This means that the obstacles won't jump around every frame and you can change the seed until you get one that positions the obstacles fairly.

--- code ---
---
language: python
filename: main.py - draw_obstacles()
---

def draw_obstacles(): seed(12345678)  # Any number is fine

    for i in range(6):  
        ob_x = randint(0, height)
        ob_y = randint(0, height) + frame_count
        ob_y %= height
        text('🌵', ob_x, ob_y)  # Replace with your obstacle

Testing your program has the potential to induce seizures for people with photosensitive epilepsy. If you have photosensitive epilepsy or feel you may be susceptible to a seizure, do not run your program. Instead, you can:
- 障害物があちこちに現れないように `seed ()` のコード行追加したことを確認してください
- プログラムの実行を誰かに頼んでください
- 先に進めてプロジェクトを完了し、最後に誰かにプロジェクトを実行してもらい、デバッグできるようにしてください
- Slow the game down by using `frame_rate = 10` in your call to `run()` like this:

```python
run(frame_rate = 10)
```
You can alter the speed of the game by changing `10` to a higher or lower value.

--- task ---

**Test:** Run your program and you should see multiple objects on the screen, wrapping around when they get to the bottom.

Change your code until you are happy with the obstacles you have. You can:

+ 乱数のタネを変更して、色々な所から障害物が現れるようにします
+ 障害物の数が変わるまでのループ回数を変更します
+ 障害物のサイズを調整します

**Tip:** Make sure it is possible to avoid your obstacles but that there is no easy path through your game.

**Debug:** You might find some bugs in your project that you need to fix. Here are some common bugs.

Check your function that draws multiple obstacles:
 + 障害物を描く関数を2回以上呼び出すために、 `for` ループを使っていることを確認してください
 + 障害物を描く関数に渡す(x, y) 座標を変えるのに、`randint()` を使っていることを確認してください
 + 障害物の座標として `ob_x` と `ob_y` を使っていることを確認してください

For example:

--- code ---
---
language: python
filename: main.py — draw_obstacles()
---

def draw_obstacles(): seed(12345678)

    for i in range(6):  
        ob_x = randint(0, height)
        ob_y = randint(0, height) + frame_count
        ob_y %= height
        text('🌵', ob_x, ob_y)  # Replace with your obstacle

Make sure that you have used `seed()` inside the function that draws multiple obstacles.

<p style="border-left: solid; border-width:10px; border-color: #0faeb0; background-color: aliceblue; padding: 10px;"> 
Programmers use lots of neat tricks like using the `%` operator to make objects wrap around the screen and the `seed()` function to generate the same random numbers. The more coding you do, the more neat tricks you will learn.</p>
