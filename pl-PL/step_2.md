## Set the theme

<div style="display: flex; flex-wrap: wrap">
<div style="flex-basis: 200px; flex-grow: 1; margin-right: 15px;">
Set the theme of your game and create a player character that follows the mouse pointer.

</div>

</div>
</div>

What is the theme of your game? You could choose anything you want. Here are some ideas:
- A sport or hobby
- A movie, show, or game
- Science or nature
- Anything else!

--- task ---

Open the [starter project](https://trinket.io/python/cda05e5911){:target="_blank"}. Trinket will open in another browser tab.

--- /task ---

--- task ---

**Choose:** Set the size of your canvas.

--- code ---
---
language: python filename: main.py - setup()

---
def setup():    
size(400, 400)

--- /code ---

--- /task ---

--- task ---

Create a variable called `safe` to store the background colour based on the theme you want for your game.

This is the colour that it is safe for the player to be on and you will use this variable again later.

--- code ---
---
language: python
filename: main.py - draw()
---
def draw():    
safe = color(200, 100, 0) #Add the colour of your theme   
background(safe)

--- /code ---

[[[generic-theory-simple-colours]]]

--- /task ---

--- task ---

**Test:** Run your code to see the background colour. Change it until you are happy with the colour and the size of the screen.

--- /task ---

Now choose the character that is playing the game and avoiding the obstacles. Is it an object, person, animal, or something else?

The player will appear at a fixed `y` position and same `x` position as the mouse pointer, which is stored in the `p5` variable `mouse_x`.

--- task --- It's a good idea to organise the code for drawing the player character into a function.

Define a `draw_player()` function and create a `player_y` position for the fixed `y` position of the player:

--- code ---
---
language: python
filename: main.py - draw_player()
---
def draw_player():    
player_y = int(height * 0.8) #Positioned towards the screen bottom

--- /code ---

Add code to `draw()` to call `draw_player()` each frame.

--- code ---
---
language: python
filename: main.py - draw()
---

def draw():    
safe = color(200, 100, 0) #Your chosen colour    
background(safe)    
draw_player()

--- /code ---

--- /task ---

Next you will add code to the `draw_player()` function to draw your shape. You may also need to add `setup()` code.

--- task ---

**Choose:** What does your player look like? Your player could be:
+ An image provided in the starter project
+ An emoji ðŸŽˆ or text
+ Drawn using a series of shapes

title: Use a starter image
---

Click on the **manage images** icon.

![The picture icon in the top right of the code area.](images/manage-images.png)

Images included in the starter project will be shown in the `Image library` list.

![The Image library with list of included images.](images/starter-images.png)

Make a note of the name of the image you want to use.

Load the image into the `setup()` function

--- code ---
---
language: python filename: main.py - setup()

---
def setup():   
size(400, 400)    
player = load_image('skiing.png') #Load your image

--- /code ---

Call the `image()` and set it as global in the `draw_player()` function.

--- code ---
---
language: python filename: main.py - draw_player()

---

def draw_player():    
player_y = int(height * 0.8) #Positioned towards the screen bottom

  global player

  image(player, mouse_x, player_y, 30, 30)

--- /code ---

--- /collapse ---

--- collapse ---

---
title: Use emoji characters
---

You can use emoji characters in the p5 `text()` function to use an emoji to represent your player.

Here's an example:

--- code ---
---
language: python
filename: main.py - setup()
---
def setup():    
size(400, 400)     
text_size(40) #Controls the size of the emoji     
text_align(CENTER, TOP) #Position around the centre     
--- /code ---

--- code ---
---
language: python
filename: main.py - draw_player()
---
def draw_player():     
player_y = int(height * 0.8)    
text('ðŸŽˆ', mouse_x, player_y)     
--- /code ---

--- /collapse ---

[[[processing-python-ellipse]]]

[[[processing-python-rect]]]

[[[processing-python-triangle]]]

[[[processing-stroke]]]

**Tip:** You can use several simple shapes in the same function to create a more complex player.

  #Eyes

ellipse(mouse_x - 10, player_y - 10, 10, 10)     
ellipse(mouse_x + 10, player_y - 10, 10, 10)     
fill(255)    
ellipse(mouse_x - 12, player_y - 12, 5, 5)    
ellipse(mouse_x + 12, player_y - 12, 5, 5)

**Test:** Run your code and move the mouse to control the player.

Does it move like you expect?

--- /task ---

**Debug:** You might find some bugs in your project that you need to fix. Here are some common bugs.

--- task ---

--- collapse ---
---
title: I can't see the player
---

Try switching to full screen. Also, check the `x` and `y` coordinates that you used to draw the player â€”Â make sure they are inside the canvas you created with `size()`. --- /collapse ---

--- collapse ---
---
title: An image isn't loading
---

First, check that the image is in the `Image library`. Then, check the filename really carefully â€” remember capital letters are different to lower case letters and punctuation is important.

--- /collapse ---

--- collapse ---
---
title: An image is the wrong size
---

Check the inputs that control the width and height of the image:

```python
image(image_file, x_coord, y_coord, width, height)
```

--- /collapse ---

--- collapse ---
---
title: An emoji is the wrong size
---

If your emoji is too big or too small, change the input to `text_size()`.
